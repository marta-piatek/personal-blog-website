                <h2>This lavender farm near Toronto makes for a colourful socially distanced day trip</h2>
                <div class="description">Story by Marta Piatek | Senior Journalist at CBC News | Published July 21</div>
                <p>There are many lavender fields near Toronto but now you can add another one to the list. Neob Lavender, growers of lavender who produce essential oil based beauty products, has a popular Niagara on the Lake retail location with its very own lavender farm. Their farm is open this season for roaming tours of their lavender fields.</p> 
                <p>Finding pandemic-friendly trips and activities is an exciting but challenging task but this day trip is not only beautiful, fun, and close to Toronto but it also follows COVID-19 safety guidelines in terms of physical and social distancing.
                "We are limiting the number of people in the field at any given time and using directional arrows to create a one-way flow through the field," says Robert Achal, co-founder of Neob Lavender. A lavender field can transport you to a purple-paradise that smells amazing and is extremely photogenic but according to their website, the only way to see the fields this year is through self-guided roaming as there will be no official tours for the 2020 season.</p>

                <p><q>For the first time in 10 years, we didn’t schedule tours,</q> Achal said. <q>It was in the best interest to keep our staff and visitors safe.</q>
                Achal told blogTO that they received lots of inquiries about tours but visitors seemed pleased with the intimacy in the field this year.
                <q>Visitors can roam the lavender field which is great for taking picturesque photos in a unique aromatic field,</q> says Achal.</p>
                <p class="text-underline">"We've had proposals, family pictures, romantic outings - all types of unique reasons to visit the lavender field and capture a special moment," he said.
                According to Achal, people leave happy and relaxed. "I truly believe the lavender field helps relieve some of the stresses we are all experiencing. It is a truly unique experience," he said.</p>
